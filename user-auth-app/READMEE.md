### Running the Server

1. **Start the Server**

   Start the server by running the command: `npm start`.

2. **Verify the Server is Running**

   - Ensure that the server has started correctly; you should see a message indicating that the server is running (e.g., "MongoDB connected").
   - The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port your server is configured to use).

### Additional Notes

- Make sure that your MongoDB instance is running before starting the server.
- Update any environment-specific configurations if needed.
